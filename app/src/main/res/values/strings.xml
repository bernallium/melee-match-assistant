        cannot agree on who gets to use which port, then the player with <i>port selection priority</i> chooses first. Port selection priority is decided via RPS, except in Game 1, where it is
        automatically granted to the player who did not get first stage strike).

        \nEach game, players may also request for the use of <i>neutral ports</i> only.
        If both port selection priority and neutral ports are invoked,
        then the player with port selection priority chooses a neutral port first and the other players uses the remaining neutral port.</string>
